Get off to a good start in bioinformatics with this three-part online workshop in R. This workshop lays the foundation for successful bioinformatics experiments, including RNA-Seq, single cell RNA-Seq, epigenetics and more.

This workshop consists of three half-day sessions, combining lecture and exercises in a survey of the basics of R for bioinformatics. Completion of this material will allow participants to get the most out of our other experiment-centric workshops. We recommend this course for all beginners.

Introduction to R for Bioinformatics is scheduled from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm on Friday, March 12, Tuesday, March 16, and Friday, March 19.

Participants must have access to a computer with a recent version of R, and Rstudio installed, as well as a reliable internet connection.

The registration fee is $300 for UC students, postdocs, staff and faculty, $450 for Non-UC academic or non-profit participants and $600 for other participants. We accept credit cards, as well as UC Davis recharge accounts, for payment. We are pleased to be able to offer three group pricing bundle options for labs with multiple registrants: 15% off registration for groups of 3-5, 25% off registration for groups of 6-10, and custom instructional packages for groups larger than 10. If you are interested in one of these pricing options, please contact us at training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu for a custom coupon code.

Registration closes on March 10, 2021.

### FAQ

Who should attend? … Prior course participants have included faculty, post docs, grad students, staff, and industry researchers.

What are the prerequisites? … There are no prerequisites other than an enthusiasm for learning bioinformatics data analysis.

What do I need? … You will need access to a computer with a recent version of R and Rstudio installed, as well as a reliable internet connection. If your department does not allow you to install software on your computer, please contact us ahead of time.

Can I bring my own data? … We will provide experimental datasets for use during the workshop, as this helps to keep the workshop moving. There will be time, however, to discuss your own datasets and how you might work with them outside of the workshop.

How do I apply? … All registration is “first-come, first-served”. There is no application process.  Sign up as soon as possible to ensure your place in the workshop.
