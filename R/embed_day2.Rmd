# Intro to R Day 2

---

Load your day 1 workspace data:
```{r}
load("day1.RData")
```

### Lists
#### A list is an ordered collection of objects, which can be any type of R objects (vectors, matrices, data frames, even lists).

##### A list is constructed using the function list().

```{r}
my_list <- list(1:5, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), c(3.2, 103.0, 82.3))
my_list
str(my_list)
```

##### One could construct a list by giving names to elements.

```{r}
my_list <- list(Ranking=1:5, ID="a", Test=c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), Score=c(3.2, 103.0, 82.3))

# display the names of elements in the list using the function *names*, or *str*. Compare the output of *str* with the above results to see the difference.
names(my_list)
str(my_list)
```

```{r}
# number of elements in the list
length(my_list)
```

### Subsetting data

#### Subsetting allows one to access the piece of data of interest. When combinded with assignment, subsetting can modify selected pieces of data. The operators that can be used to subset data are: [, $, and [[.

##### First, we are going to talk about subsetting data using [, which is the most commonly used operator. We will start by looking at vectors and talk about four ways to subset a vector.

* `r colFmt("**Positive integers** return elements at the specified positions", 'purple')`

```{r}
# first to recall what are stored in gene_names
gene_names
# obtain the first and the third elements
gene_names[c(1,3)]
```

R uses 1 based indexing, meaning the first element is at the position 1, not at position 0.

* `r colFmt("**Negative integers** omit elements at the specified positions", 'purple')`

```{r}
gene_names[-c(1,3)]
```

One may not mixed positive and negative integers in one single subset operation.

```{r error=TRUE}
# The following command will produce an error.
gene_names[c(-1, 2)]
```

* `r colFmt("**Logical vectors** select elements where the corresponding logical value is TRUE", 'purple')`, This is very useful because one may write the expression that creates the logical vector.

```{r}
gene_names[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```

Recall that we have created one vector called *gene_expression*. Let's assume that *gene_expression* stores the expression values correspond to the genes in *gene_names*. Then we may subset the genes based on expression values.

```{r}
gene_expression

gene_names[gene_expression > 50]
```

If the logical vector is shorter in length than the data vector that we want to subset, then it will be recycled to be the same length as the data vector.

```{r}
gene_names[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
```

If the logical vector has "NA" in it, the corresponding value will be "NA" in the output. "NA" in R is a symbol for missing value.

```{r}
gene_names[c(TRUE, NA, FALSE, TRUE, NA)]
```

* `r colFmt("**Character vectors** return elements with matching names, when the vector is named.", 'purple')`

```{r}
gene_expression
gene_expression[c("ESR1", "p53")]
```

* `r colFmt("**Nothing** returns the original vector", 'purple')`, This is more useful for matrices, data frames than for vectors.

```{r}
gene_names[]
```

<br>

##### Subsetting a list works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector. Using [ will always return a list.

```{r}
my_list[1]
```
<br>

##### Subsetting a matrix can be done by simply generalizing the one dimension subsetting: one may supply a one dimension index for each dimension of the matrix. `r colFmt("Blank/Nothing subsetting is now useful in keeping all rows or all columns.", 'red')`


```{r}
my_matrix[c(TRUE, FALSE), ]
```
<br>

##### Subsetting a data frame can be done similarly as subsetting a matrix. In addition, one may supply only one 1-dimensional index to subset a data frame. In this case, R will treat the data frame as a list with each column is an element in the list.

```{r}
# recall a data frame created from above: *meta.data*
meta.data
# subset the data frame similarly to a matrix
meta.data[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE),]

# subset the data frame using one vector
meta.data[c("patients_age", "disease_stage")]
```

<br>

### Subsetting operators: **[[** and **$**

##### **[[** is similar to **[**, except that it returns the content of the element.

```{r}
# recall my_list
my_list
# comparing [[ with [ in subsetting a list
my_list[[1]]
my_list[1]
```

`r colFmt("[[ is very useful when working with a list. Because when [ is applied to a list, it always returns a list. While [[ returns the contents of the list. [[ can only extrac/return one element, so it only accept one integer/string as input.", 'red')`

Because data frames are implemented as lists of columns, one may use [[ to extract a column from data frames.

```{r}
meta.data[["disease_stage"]]
```


<br>

##### **$** is a shorthand for **[[** combined with character subsetting.

```{r}
# subsetting a list using $ 
my_list$Score
# subsetting a data frame using
meta.data$disease_stage
```

<br>

##### Simplifying vs. preserving subsetting

We have seen some examples of simplying vs. preserving subsetting, for example:

```{r}
# simplifying subsetting
my_list[[1]]
# preserving subsetting
my_list[1]
```

Basically, simplying subsetting returns the simplest possible data structure that can represent the output. While preserving subsetting keeps the structure of the output as the same as the input. In the above example, [[ simplifies the output to a vector, while [ keeps the output as a list.

Because the syntax of carrying out simplifying and preserving subsetting differs depending on the data structure, the table below provides the information for the most basic data structure.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(data.frame(Simplifying=c("x[[1]]", "x[[1]]", "x[1:3, drop=T]", "x[, 1] or x[[1]]"), Preserving=c("x[1]", "x[1]", "x[1:3]", "x[, 1, drop=F] or x[1]"), row.names=c("Vector", "List", "Factor", "Data frame"), stringsAsFactors=F), align='c') %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options="striped", full_width=F, position="left")
```

## CHALLENGES

Using the built-in dataset **iris**, first subset the dataframe keeping only those rows where the sepal length is greater than 6. Then find the total number for each Species in that subset.

Using **iris**, remove the width columns and then create a new dataframe with the Species and the sum of the rows.

Topic 3. Import and export data in R
====================================================

##### R base function read.table() is a general funciton that can be used to read a file in table format. The data will be imported as a data frame.

```{r}
# There is a very convenient way to read files from the internet.
data1 <- read.table(file="https://github.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics-training/courses/raw/master/Intro2R/raw_counts.txt", sep="\t", header=T, stringsAsFactors=F)

# To read a local file. If you have downloaded the raw_counts.txt file to your local machine, you may use the following command to read it in, by providing the full path for the file location. The way to specify the full path is the same as taught in the command line session.
download.file("https://github.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics-training/courses/raw/master/Intro2R/raw_counts.txt", "./raw_counts.txt")
data1 <- read.table(file="./raw_counts.txt", sep="\t", header=T, stringsAsFactors=F)

```

To check what type of object *data1* is in and take a look at the beginning part of the data.
```{r}
is.data.frame(data1)
head(data1)
```


##### Depending on the format of the file, several variants of read.table() are available to make reading a file easier.

* read.csv(): for reading "comma separated value" files (.csv).

* read.csv2(): variant used in countries that use a comma "," as decimal point and a semicolon ";" as field separators.

* read.delim(): for reading "tab separated value" files (".txt"). By default, point(".") is used as decimal point.

* read.delim2(): for reading "tab separated value" files (".txt"). By default, comma (",") is used as decimal point.

<br>

```{r}
# We are going to read a file over the internet by providing the url of the file.
data2 <- read.csv(file="https://github.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics-training/courses/raw/master/Intro2R/raw_counts.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

# To look at the file:
head(data2)
```

<br>

##### R base function write.table() can be used to export data to a file.

```{r}
# To write to a file called "output.txt" in your current working directory.
write.table(data2[1:20,], file="output.txt", sep="\t", quote=F, row.names=T, col.names=T)
```

It is also possible to export data to a csv file.

write.csv()

write.csv2()

Topic 4. R markdown and R notebooks
====================================================

Markdown is a system that allow easy incorporation of annotations/comments together with computing code. Both the raw source of markdown file and the rendered output are easy to read. R markdown allows both interactive mode with R and producing a reproducible document. An R notebook is an R markdown document with code chunks that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input. In RStudio, by default, all R markdown documents are run in R notebook mode. Under the R notebook mode, when executing a chunk, the code is sent to the console to be run one line at a time. This allows execution to stop if a line raises an error.

<br>

In RStudio, creating an R notebook can be done by going to the menu command ** File -> New File -> R Notebook **.

An example of an R notebook looks like:


![](./notebook.png)


The way to run the R code inside the code chunk is to use the green arrow located at the top right corner of each of the code chunk, or use ** Ctrl + Shift + Enter ** on Windows, or ** Cmd + Shift + Enter ** on Mac to run the current code chunk. To run each individual code line, one uses ** Ctrl + Enter ** on Windows, or ** Cmd + Enter ** on Mac.

To render R notebook to html/pdf/word documents can be done using the **Preview** menu.

Topic 5. Functions in R
====================================================
#### Invoking a function by its name, followed by the parenthesis and zero or more arguments.

```{r}
# to find out the current working directory
getwd()

# to set a different working directory, use setwd
#setwd("/Users/jli/Desktop")

# to list all objects in the environment
ls()

# to create a vector from 2 to 3, using increment of 0.1
seq(2, 3, by=0.1)

# to create a vector with repeated elements
rep(1:3, times=3)
rep(1:3, each=3)

# to get help information on a function in R: ?function.name
?seq
?sort
?rep

```  

##### `r colFmt("One useful function to find out information on an R object: str(). It compactly display the internal structure of an R object.", 'red')`  


```{r}
str(data2)
```


#### Conditional structure

Decision making is important in programming. This can be achieved using an **if...else** statement.

The basic structure of an *if...else* statement is 

**if (condition statement){**

	**some operation**

**}**


Two examples of *if...else* statement

```{r}

Temperature <- 30

if (Temperature < 32) {
  print("Very cold")
}

```

```{r}
# recall gene_expression, we are going to design a *if...else* statement to decide treatment plans based on gene expression.

if (gene_expression["ESR1"] > 0) {
  print("Treatment plan 1")
} else if (gene_expression["BRCA1"] > 0) {
  print("Treatment plan 2")
} else if (gene_expression["p53"] > 0) {
  print("Treatment plan 3")
} else {
  print("Treatment plan 4")
}

```

Save your workspace so we can load it for day 3:
```{r}
save.image("day2.RData")
```


## HOMEWORK

Using the state.x77 built-in dataset, find the states whose population (in 1000's) is greater than 950 AND whose High School Graduation Rate is less than 40%.

Construct a list with three elements:

1. A vector of numbers 1 through 15 in increments of 0.2
2. A 5x5 matrix using the first 25 letters of the alphabet. (Hint: look at built-in constants)
3. The first 10 elements of the built-in data frame "mtcars".
